Every evening I take 10 minutes to journal about my day. In a few sentences, I write about what I’ve accomplished, what I’ve learned, and anything that’s worth remembering.

That simple exercise helps me to:

Remember what I did (sounds stupid, but we forget most things we do).
    Review my progress and see whether I’m doing all the things that I should be doing (like reading, working out, spending time with my family, writing, talking to people I work with).

I’ve learned this exercise from Jim Rohn. He says:

    “At the end of each day, you should play back the tapes of your performance. The results should either applaud you or prod you.”

It’s simple: Close the day before you start a new day. Also, close every week before you start a new week. Similar for every month, and every year.

Sounds simple, right? It’s one of those “simple” ideas that have a huge impact on your life.
