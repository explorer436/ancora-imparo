Common for all OSs:
-------------------

IDEs : 

* IntelliJ Idea (Probably don't need Visual Studio Code if we have this.)
* Eclipse (Optional Plugins : TestNG, EclEmma Code Coverage, Spring Tools 4) 
* Visual Studio Code :
	* Themes: 
		* azure (nice theme but it doesn't apply to file menu on the left)
		* light theme (I like to use it in daylight),
		* GitHub Theme (nice theme that applies to file menu on the left)
	* Plugins: 
		* (It is probably good idea to stick with Eclipse for anything related to Java) Language Support for Java
		* (It is probably good idea to stick with Eclipse for anything related to Java) Debugger for Java
		* haskell-linter
		* Haskell Syatax Highlighting
		* Open in Vim
		* Vim plugin for Visual Studio Code (this cuts down the pain of setting up something like Emacs)
		* Markdown preview
	* Customizations:
		* To remove the sideview bar (called the minimap), set "editor.minimap.enabled": false in your user or workspace settings.

* (ignore this) jEdit : Plugins: Project Viewer (Not as useful as other editors - Visual Studio Code is probably better)

Text editors

* Vim
* gVim

Browsers : 

* Firefox(lastpass, instapaper)
* Tor browser

Miscellaneous : 

* Calibre ebook editor and viewer

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows:
-----------
* Git + Good git interface for Windows
* Text editors : 
	* Notepad++ - plugins: Compare plugin,XML tools plugin, 
	* Vim
* 7 zip
* Console Emulation program - ConEmu

Linux:
-----------
* Git + Good git interface for Linux - 
	* gitg (lighter and faster - lets us stage individual lines and chunks)
	* GitAhead (Did not use this all that much)
	* Eclipse eGit plugin is probably best. It works the same way in all OSs and it has all the features we really need.
				     
* Ghostwriter - good editor to work with markdown files. Formats them exactly the way github expects. One problem that I noticed with this app is, if you open a file in it, and make changes to that file using some other app at the same time (like Vim, VS Code, etc.) and save the changes to the file there, those changes are not reloaded into Ghostwriter automatically. What is worse is, as soon as the file is closed in Ghostwriter, the changes made to the file (using the other apps) are reverted. All those changes are lost. This is a bad use case. This app is good for looking at files and making changes to files but it is not great at working with other apps simultaneously. Maybe, it would be a good idea to stick to Visual Studio Code for md files as well. The markdown preview in Visual Studio Code is not that bad. Use Ghostwriter only if it is absolutely mandatory.

* Broot (Directory navigators)
                 
* IDEs (See common section above)
       
* File managers
	* Thunar
	* PCManFM (not really necessary if you already have Thunar)
	* Vifm is a curser based vi[m] like file manager extended with some useful ideas from mutt. If you use vi[m], vifm gives you complete keyboard control over your files without having to learn a new set of commands. It goes not just about vi[m] like keybindings, but also about modes, options, registers, commands and other things you might already like in vi[m].
		
* System Monitors
	* HTop  

* Screenshot utility
	* Flameshot (never used)

* Graphics tools
	* Blender (never used)
	* Pinta (never used)
	* Gimp (never used)
		 
* Office suites
	* Libre office
	* Open office (never used)
	* Calligra (never used)
	* wps office? (used - the interface is good. But support for fonts is not as good as that of LibreOffice? Some fonts were totally unreadable)
		
* img2pdf (to convert images into pdf documents) - (usage: in terminal: $ img2pdf img1.png img2.jpg -o out.pdf) (img2pdf --help)
* pdf arranger (to work with pdf documents - joining multiple pdf documents into one)

* GNU web browser - to keep firefox and regular surfing separate (Chromium is an alternative to this).
* Variety (Nitrogen is an alternative) - wallpaper utility tool. Generally, there are great wallpapers on unsplash.com. There is an option in Variety's preferences to pull wallpapers from unsplash.

How to use multiple workspaces : 

This is useful in both Windows and Linux. This makes the workflow so much easier than switching between windows in a single workspace.
Keyboard shortcuts are available. 

Hold down Ctrl + Alt and tap an arrow key to 
quickly move up, down, left, or right between workspaces, 
depending on how they’re laid out. 

Add the Shift key—so, press Shift + Ctrl + Alt and 
tap an arrow key—and you’ll switch between workspaces, 
taking the currently active window with you to the new workspace.

Ready API/Soap UI preferences:

Parses the WSDL files and generates SOAP messages for you # Wizdler

Recognizes WSDL information on the page to show you the available services and operations. Click the operation to generate the SOAP requests and view the response. By clicking the service, you can download WSDL and external XSD files in single ZIP file.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Swagger YAML  editing tool : http://editor.swagger.io/
use this to generate server code and client code as well.

Stoplight studio is another good one.
