How to use multiple workspaces : 

This is useful in both Windows and Linux. This makes the workflow so much easier than switching between windows in a single workspace.
Keyboard shortcuts are available. 

Hold down Ctrl + Alt and tap an arrow key to 
quickly move up, down, left, or right between workspaces, 
depending on how they’re laid out. 

Add the Shift key—so, press Shift + Ctrl + Alt and 
tap an arrow key—and you’ll switch between workspaces, 
taking the currently active window with you to the new workspace.
