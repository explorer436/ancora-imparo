*** Cntlm

Updating password in cntlm : 

In a Linux slice, cntlm config file is usually located here : 

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    /etc/cntlm.conf
    or
    /usr/local/etc/cntlm.conf
    #+END_EXAMPLE

Many corporate security policies require regular password changes, CNTLM makes these very easy.

First, get the hashes for the new password with: 
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    cntlm -H
    #+END_EXAMPLE

Copy and paste those hashes into your cntlm.conf file located at: 
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    /etc/cntlm.conf
    or 
    /usr/local/etc/cntlm.conf
    #+END_EXAMPLE

(if you get this error while trying to edit the file : readonly option is set (add ! to override) - 
This happens when the user is trying to write on a file without the right permissions. Login as root using sudo su and now you can do the edit.)

Restart your CNTLM instance and reconnect, you should be good to go 
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    : brew services restart cntlm (if you have brew installed)
    #+END_EXAMPLE

If this doesn't work, restarting the slice using the command 'reboot' works.
