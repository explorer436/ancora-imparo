- Visual Studio Code :
	- Themes: 
		- azure (nice theme but it doesn't apply to file menu on the left)
		- light theme (I like to use it in daylight),
		- GitHub Theme (nice theme that applies to file menu on the left)
	- Plugins: 
		- haskell-linter
		- Haskell Syatax Highlighting
		- Open in Vim (if working with Vim is not possible)
		- Vim plugin for Visual Studio Code (this cuts down the pain of setting up something like Emacs)
		- Markdown preview (Use ghostwriter instead of this if possible)
	- Customizations:
		- To remove the sideview bar (called the minimap), set "editor.minimap.enabled": false in your user or workspace settings.
