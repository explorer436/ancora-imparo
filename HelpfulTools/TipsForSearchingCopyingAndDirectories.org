How to find files on windows modified/created after a given date using the command line? You can use PowerShell to do this :

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

How to copy everything from one folder to another folder?

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ROBOCOPY sourceFolder   destinationFolder /MIR /R:0 /W:0
    
    ROBOCOPY C:\Users\n123456\Desktop   C:\Users\n123456\Downloads\NewFolder /MIR /R:0 /W:0
    #+END_EXAMPLE
Be careful before using this command. If there are files or folders in the destination folder before using this command, they will all be erased. Make sure this command is used to copy files into a new folder only.


In Mac OSX: A few commands that help in copying files in Mac OSX:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    cp -R "/Volumes/SIGNATURE/folder1" "/Users/explorer436/Google Drive"
    
    cp -R "/Volumes/SIGNATURE/folder2" "/Users/explorer436/Google Drive"

To list the files and folders in a directory and to list their sizes:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    du â€“ displaying disk usage for a specific file, folder, directory, or whatever, is made easier to interpret with -h
    
    du -sh */
    #+END_EXAMPLE


While you are using cp command to copy huge folders, to find out how much data is copied, go to Applications -> Utilities -> Activity Monitor -> Disk view

And look at the process name 'cp'



To copy only missing files from one folder to another, use rsync :
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    rsync -av /Users/harshavardhanedupuganti/Google\ Drive/harsha_personal_stuff/  /Volumes/SIGNATURE/Google\ Drive/harsha_personal_stuff/

    rsync -av /source-path/source-dir /destination-path
    #+END_EXAMPLE
rsync will copy only new and changed files to the new location.

It is important to understand how a trailing slash on the source argument functions. If there is a trailing slash then the contents of /source-path/source-dir will be copied to destination-path. If there is no trailing slash then source-dir itself will be copied to the destination and its contents will be another level down in the destination hierarchy.

So if you want to replicate one path to another include the trailing slash as follows:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    rsync -av /sourcepath/sourcedir/ /duplicatpath/sourcedir/
    #+END_EXAMPLE
