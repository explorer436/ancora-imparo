Interesting comments about Vim :

It's simply a piece of software that integrates several tools needed for Development in a single instance. Vim comes bare bone but plug ins can easily be installed using Plug ins Manager such as Vundle or Vim Plug.

It can then provide for capabilities including but not limited to:

- Version control within a few strokes such as GitGutter and Fugitive e.g. :Gstatus

- Syntax checking using Syntastic

- NERDTree to provide Tree like document view

- Goyo providing Zen Mode

- Plethora of themes and awesome power lines such as Airline

- Spell checker that comes by default

- EasyMotion for rapid motion throughout a document without the use of the mouse

- Additional support for languages such as Markdown

How to switch between Vim and terminal when using Vim in a terminal (found this when looking for differences between Vim and GVim)

With vim (not gVim) you can get benefit from ctrl-Z

if you want to test your codes in shell/terminal, or execute some shell commands during your editing. 
In vim you can just ctrl-z to back to terminal do what you want, and fg back to vim. 
With Gvim, you cannot do that.
