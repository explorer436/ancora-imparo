How to change upper case words to lower case words?

You can change the case of text:

    Toggle case "HellO" to "hELLo" with g~ then a movement (word or end of line). 
    Uppercase "HellO" to "HELLO" with gU then a movement (word or end of line). 
    Lowercase "HellO" to "hello" with gu then a movement (word or end of line). 
    
Alternatively(easier to remember), you can visually select text then press ~ to toggle case, or U to convert to uppercase, or u to convert to lowercase.
