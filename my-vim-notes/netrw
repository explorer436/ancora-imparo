Vim documentation: pi_netrw
http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/pi_netrw.html#netrw
--------------------------------------------
Invoking netrw can be achieved in three ways
    :Explore (:E) - opens netrw in the current window
    :Sexplore (:Sex) - opens netrw in a horizontal split
    :Vexplore (:Vex) - opens netrw in a vertical split
--------------------------------------------
Changing the directory view in netrw
With the directory browser open hit i to cycle through the view types. There are four different view types: thin, long, wide and tree. A preferred view type can be made permanent by setting it in a .vimrc file.

let g:netrw_liststyle = 3
--------------------------------------------
Removing the banner
The directory banner is mostly useless. To remove it temporarily press I. To remove it permanently add the following to your .vimrc.

let g:netrw_banner = 0
--------------------------------------------
Changing how files are opened
By default files will be opened in the same window as the netrw directory browser. To change this behaviour the netrw_browse_split option may be set. The options are as follows
    1 - open files in a new horizontal split
    2 - open files in a new vertical split
    3 - open files in a new tab
    4 - open in previous window
To make the selection permanent add the following to your .vimrc.

let g:netrw_browse_split = 1
--------------------------------------------
Set the width of the directory explorer
The width of the directory explorer can be fixed with the netrw_browse_split option. The following sets the width to 25% of the page.

let g:netrw_winsize = 25
--------------------------------------------
NERDtree like setup
If NERDtree is your thing netrw can give you a similar experience with the following settings

let g:netrw_banner = 0
let g:netrw_liststyle = 3
let g:netrw_browse_split = 4
let g:netrw_altv = 1
let g:netrw_winsize = 25
augroup ProjectDrawer
  autocmd!
  autocmd VimEnter * :Vexplore
augroup END
--------------------------------------------
There are a number of ways to open files in vim and if that is what you use netrw for. 

Using find within vim can open files and supports tab completion.
:find path/to/file.txt

To open a file in a vertical split use the following. This also supports tab completion.
:vs path/to/file.txt

To open a file in a horizontal split use the following. This also supports tab completion.
:sp path/to/file.txt

To open a file in a new tab use the following. This also supports tab completion.
