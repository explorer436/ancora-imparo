How to generate tags and use them for navigation in a big java project?
Go to the root folder of the project and execute this command : ctags -R

The next step is to get the full path of this tags file - in Linux, use the readlink utility to get the full path.
[n0281526@VDDP14P-4UCXMSH renters-api-sb2]$ readlink -f tags
/home/n0281526/Downloads/GitRepositories/renters-api-sb2/tags

open a file in the root folder of the project and run this command from within vim (use semi-colon and then type it)
set tags=./tags;/
(It starts with a tags file in the current directory and goes up to the root directory.)
