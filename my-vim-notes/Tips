How to change lower case letters words to upper case words? How to change upper case words to lower case words?
You can change the case of text:
    Toggle case "HellO" to "hELLo" with g~ then a movement (word or end of line). 
    Uppercase "HellO" to "HELLO" with gU then a movement (word or end of line). 
    Lowercase "HellO" to "hello" with gu then a movement (word or end of line). 
Alternatively(easier to remember), you can visually select text then press ~ to toggle case, or U to convert to uppercase, or u to convert to lowercase.

TEXT SELECTION :

If you want to do the same thing to a collection of lines, like cut, copy, sort, or format, you first need to select the text. Get out of insert mode, hit one of the options below, and then move up or down a few lines. You should see the selected text highlighted.

V       - selects entire lines 
v       - selects range of text
ctrl-v  - selects columns
gv      - reselect block

After selecting the text, try d to cut/delete, or y to copy, or :s/match/replace/, or :center, or !sort, or...
Move to cursor where you would like to paste.
Press P to paste before the cursor, or p to paste after.

SEARCH AND REPLACE :

How do I convert all occurrences of ABC to XYZ in a file using the vi/vim editor?  :1,$s/ABC/XYZ/g   and then press [Enter]. This vi command replaces every occurrence of ABC with XYZ on every line, and even when there are multiple occurrences on a line.  Note that in this example, the "g" character at the end of the command means "global". If you don't use this "g" the tab character will only be replaced the first time it is seen on a line, but if you add the "g" at the end of the command every tab character in each line will be replaced.

/ : Search
*/# : Search forward/back for word under cursor

:%s/search_for_this/replace_with_this/    - search whole file and replace
:%s/search_for_this/replace_with_this/c   - confirm each replace
To convert each tab in the file to four spaces : 1,$s/\t/    /g
How to replace all tabs with spaces :%s/\t/    /g

General tips for searching : 

/pattern       - search forward for pattern
?pattern       - search backward
n              - repeat forward search
N              - repeat backward

:set ignorecase - case insensitive
:set smartcase  - use case if any caps used 
:set incsearch  - show match as search proceeds
:set hlsearch   - search highlighting

More cool searching tricks:
*               - search for word currently under cursor
g*              - search for partial word under cursor (repeat with n)
ctrl-o, ctrl-i  - go through jump locations
[I              - show lines with matching word under cursor
------------------------------------------
LINE NUMBERS :
To display line numbers :set number (To turn off the line number display :set nonumber)

To enable line numbers on startup, simply add the following to your vimrc - set number
Relative Line Numbers : To display line numbers relative to the line with the cursor, :set relativenumber or :set norelativenumber

COPY AND PASTE:
How to copy a line in vim and paste it in a different program (a browser or word document or email):
