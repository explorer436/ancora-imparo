To turn  it off `:set nospell`

** Using Spellchecking:

To move to a misspelled word, use `]s` (the next misspelled word) and `[s` (the previous misspelled word).

Once the cursor is on the word, use z=, and Vim will suggest a list of alternatives that it thinks may be correct.

What if Vim is wrong, and the word is correct? 
Use the zg command and Vim will add it to its dictionary. Simple as pie. You can also mark words as incorrect using zw.
