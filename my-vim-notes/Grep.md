Sometimes, it is best not to run grep within Vim and to run it standalone in terminal :

In terminal, navigate to the project folder and use this : grep -r -n -l i text_to_search *

-r recursive - search in current and sub directories
-n show line numbers in the results
-l only list the names of the files
i case insensitive search. grep is case sensitive by default
* search in files of all types
