	" tab pages to edit multiple files, but it is still best to enable an option to
	" allow easier switching between files.
	"
	" One such option is the 'hidden' option, which allows you to re-use the same
	" window and switch from an unsaved buffer without saving it first. Also allows
	" you to keep an undo history for multiple files when re-using the same window
	" in this way. Note that using persistent undo also lets you undo in multiple
	" files even in the same window, but is less efficient and is actually designed
	" for keeping undo history after closing Vim entirely. Vim will complain if you
	" try to quit without saving, and swap files will keep you safe if your computer
	" crashes.
	" Note that not everyone likes working this way (with the hidden option).

	" set confirm
	" set autowriteall"
