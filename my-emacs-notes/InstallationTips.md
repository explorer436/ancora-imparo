1. Installed emacs using homebrew. The command used is brew install --cask emacs
2. Tried to launch it using the icon in "Applications"
3. Saw this error "Emacs canâ€™t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software."
4. Had to run this to get it installed with Apple's Gatekeeper disabled. "brew reinstall --cask emacs --no-quarantine"
5. Was able to launch emacs successfully
