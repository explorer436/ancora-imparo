A few commands that help in copying files in Mac OSX :



cp -R "/Volumes/SIGNATURE/folder1" "/Users/explorer436/Google Drive"

cp -R "/Volumes/SIGNATURE/folder2" "/Users/explorer436/Google Drive"

cp -R "/Volumes/SIGNATURE/folder3/folder4/folder5" "/Volumes/SIGNATURE"

du â€“ displaying disk usage for a specific file, folder, directory, or whatever, is made easier to interpret with -h

du -sh */





While you are using cp command to copy huge folders, to find out how much data is copied, go to Applications -> Utilities -> Activity Monitor -> Disk view

And look at the process name 'cp'



To copy only missing files from one folder to another, use rsync :

rsync -av /Users/harshavardhanedupuganti/Google\ Drive/harsha_personal_stuff/  /Volumes/SIGNATURE/Google\ Drive/harsha_personal_stuff/



rsync -av /source-path/source-dir /destination-path
rsync will copy only new and changed files to the new location.

It is important to understand how a trailing slash on the source argument functions. If there is a trailing slash then the contents of /source-path/source-dir will be copied to destination-path. If there is no trailing slash then source-dir itself will be copied to the destination and its contents will be another level down in the destination hierarchy.

So if you want to replicate one path to another include the trailing slash as follows:

rsync -av /sourcepath/sourcedir/ /duplicatpath/sourcedir/
