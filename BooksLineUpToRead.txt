All books are NOT created equal. To measure the quality of a book, ask yourself : Do I walk away from the book looking at the world around me differently?

Reading books about great people is inspiring.
Read business and finance books for insight.
Prefer non-fiction over fiction.

Read some good, heavy, serious books just for discipline: Take yourself in hand and master yourself - (Letter from W. E. B. Du Bois to Yolande Du Bois)

Literature is the accumulation of painful lessons humans have learned by trial and error.

I read an interview where Neil Strauss mentioned John Fante’s Ask the Dust, so I bought it, read it, and fell in love with it… and in reading about John Fante, I learned that he’d been influenced by Nietzsche and Knut Hamsun, so I read both of them. Napoleon and Alexander Hamilton were changed by Plutarch’s Lives (and so were about a million other people across history), so of course, I read it. I heard that Phil Jackson recommended his players read Corelli’s Mandolin, and that Pete Carroll recommends The Inner Game of Tennis. Lots of successful people have reading lists that they either post on their blogs or that their biographers have compiled after their deaths. I made my way through those, too, book by book.

Everybody seems to want a mentor. Meanwhile, they’re passing up the opportunity to learn directly from the people who taught the people you aspire to be. When someone like John McCain spends his whole life raving about For Whom The Bell Tolls, why would you not check it out? Clearly, it got him through some shit. Peter Thiel credits Rene Girard and Things Hidden Since the Foundation Of the World with shaping his worldview. Clearly, it’s made him some money?—?you’re not going to pick that up? Angela Merkel?—?Forbes’ number one most powerful women for 12 of the last 13 years?—?lists Leo Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina and Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov as her favorite reads. Add them to the list!

‘The Hard Thing About Hard Things’ By Ben Horowitz
This book is insanely well-written and very funny, but very serious at the same time. It has many moments of lightness to balance out the weight of big concepts.
I love this one because it reinforces my belief that anything worth doing is difficult. In business, there are patterns. And we can learn from others’ failures. But there is no recipe for success.
Every leader has to conquer their own “hard things.”

Holistic medicine and such books as Norman Cousins’s account of his successful fight against terminal illness and Dr. Bernie Siegel’s descriptions of self-healing are beginning to redress the abstractly materialist view of health that has become so prevalent in this century.

Recommendations by Bill Gates : 

None of them are what most people think of as a light read. All but one deal with the idea of disruption, but I don’t mean “disruption” in the way tech people usually mean it. I’ve recently found myself drawn to books about upheaval (that’s even the title of the one of them)—whether it’s the Soviet Union right after the Bolshevik revolution, the United States during times of war, or a global reevaluation of our economic system.

If you’re looking for something that’s more of a typical summer book, I recommend Graeme Simsion’s The Rosie Result. (And if you haven’t read the first two books in the Rosie trilogy, summer vacation is the perfect time to start!) I also can’t resist a plug for Melinda’s new book The Moment of Lift. I know I’m biased, but it’s one of the best books I’ve read so far this year.

Here is my full summer reading list:

Upheaval, by Jared Diamond. I’m a big fan of everything Jared has written, and his latest is no exception. The book explores how societies react during moments of crisis. He uses a series of fascinating case studies to show how nations managed existential challenges like civil war, foreign threats, and general malaise. It sounds a bit depressing, but I finished the book even more optimistic about our ability to solve problems than I started.

Nine Pints, by Rose George. If you get grossed out by blood, this one probably isn’t for you. But if you’re like me and find it fascinating, you’ll enjoy this book by a British journalist with an especially personal connection to the subject. I’m a big fan of books that go deep on one specific topic, so Nine Pints (the title refers to the volume of blood in the average adult) was right up my alley. It’s filled with super-interesting facts that will leave you with a new appreciation for blood.

A Gentleman in Moscow, by Amor Towles. It seems like everyone I know has read this book. I finally joined the club after my brother-in-law sent me a copy, and I’m glad I did. Towles’s novel about a count sentenced to life under house arrest in a Moscow hotel is fun, clever, and surprisingly upbeat. Even if you don’t enjoy reading about Russia as much as I do (I’ve read every book by Dostoyevsky), A Gentleman in Moscow is an amazing story that anyone can enjoy.

Presidents of War, by Michael Beschloss. My interest in all aspects of the Vietnam War is the main reason I decided to pick up this book. By the time I finished it, I learned a lot not only about Vietnam but about the eight other major conflicts the U.S. entered between the turn of the 19th century and the 1970s. Beschloss’s broad scope lets you draw important cross-cutting lessons about presidential leadership.

The Future of Capitalism, by Paul Collier. Collier’s latest book is a thought-provoking look at a topic that’s top of mind for a lot of people right now. Although I don’t agree with him about everything—I think his analysis of the problem is better than his proposed solutions—his background as a development economist gives him a smart perspective on where capitalism is headed.

William Bernstein is a retired neurologist who has turned his attention to financial matters. He wrote 'The Four Pillars of Investing', which is one of the best books on investing published in the past decade.
(On why active trading is not good) If you want to get an idea of how much money the financial industry siphons from unwary investors, read James B. Stewart's 'Den of thieves', a true-life account of the insider trading scandals of the 1980s that will blow your mind.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Read "Essentialism: The Discliplined Pursuit of Less, by Greg McKeown" a few years back and it was life changing. It challenged me to take a step back and identify what were the most important things in my life and prioritize those things. I took a mental health break from social media, focused more on family, and took a minimalist approach to material things. Definitely recommended!
