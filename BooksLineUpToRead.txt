All books are NOT created equal. To measure the quality of a book, ask yourself : Do I walk away from the book looking at the world around me differently?

Reading books about great people is inspiring.
Read business and finance books for insight.
Prefer non-fiction over fiction.

Read some good, heavy, serious books just for discipline: Take yourself in hand and master yourself - (Letter from W. E. B. Du Bois to Yolande Du Bois)

Literature is the accumulation of painful lessons humans have learned by trial and error.

The Lost Wife by Alyson Richman

I read an interview where Neil Strauss mentioned John Fante’s Ask the Dust, so I bought it, read it, and fell in love with it… and in reading about John Fante, I learned that he’d been influenced by Nietzsche and Knut Hamsun, so I read both of them. Napoleon and Alexander Hamilton were changed by Plutarch’s Lives (and so were about a million other people across history), so of course, I read it. I heard that Phil Jackson recommended his players read Corelli’s Mandolin, and that Pete Carroll recommends The Inner Game of Tennis. Lots of successful people have reading lists that they either post on their blogs or that their biographers have compiled after their deaths. I made my way through those, too, book by book.


Everybody seems to want a mentor. Meanwhile, they’re passing up the opportunity to learn directly from the people who taught the people you aspire to be. When someone like John McCain spends his whole life raving about For Whom The Bell Tolls, why would you not check it out? Clearly, it got him through some shit. Peter Thiel credits Rene Girard and Things Hidden Since the Foundation Of the World with shaping his worldview. Clearly, it’s made him some money?—?you’re not going to pick that up? Angela Merkel?—?Forbes’ number one most powerful women for 12 of the last 13 years?—?lists Leo Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina and Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov as her favorite reads. Add them to the list!

‘The Hard Thing About Hard Things’ By Ben Horowitz
This book is insanely well-written and very funny, but very serious at the same time. It has many moments of lightness to balance out the weight of big concepts.
I love this one because it reinforces my belief that anything worth doing is difficult. In business, there are patterns. And we can learn from others’ failures. But there is no recipe for success.
Every leader has to conquer their own “hard things.”



Holistic medicine and such books as Norman Cousins’s account of his successful fight against terminal illness and Dr. Bernie Siegel’s descriptions of self-healing are beginning to redress the abstractly materialist view of health that has become so prevalent in this century.
