If you need to kill a process manually on Windows itâ€™s actually pretty easy. First, fire up a command prompt and type the following command.

netstat -a -o -n

To kill the process we need to find the PID of the process in question. I just run down the list by port until I find port 8080 and here you will see the process id was 28344.

Finally, with the PID we can run the following command to kill the process

taskkill /F /PID 28344

============================================================================================
In Linux : 

This command will print you PID of process bound on that port : "fuser 8080/tcp"

And this command will kill that process : "fuser -k 8080/tcp"
