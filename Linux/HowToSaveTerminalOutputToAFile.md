How do I save the output of a command to a file?

Yes it is possible, just redirect the output to a file:

SomeCommand > SomeFile.txt 

-----------------------------

This could be a very easy way to create a catalog for a directory instead of running programs to list the contents of the directory.
e.g. Go to the folder for which you are trying to create the catalog and run this command : tree > 00Catalog.txt (to create a file called 00Catalog.txt in that directory)

(See Tree.md)
