The first step is to try to determine if the keyboard is identified by the OS at all. 
To figure that out, run `lsusb` and see if the keyboard shows up in the list there. If it is detected in `lsusb`, that is a good sign. (Take a look at the command `lsusb` and the various options available with it. It can be very helpful).

After that, run `dmesg | tail`. That will give us an output that looks like this.

```
[explorer436@explorer436-cf52ekmbdam /]$ dmesg | tail

```

The key pieces of information we are looking for in the output of the above command are `idVendor` and `idProduct`.
idVendor=17ef, idProduct=6047

Note: The idVendor and idProduct can also be determined by looking at the file `usb.ids` - which is usually located at `/usr/share/misc/usb.ids`. If you cannot find the file there, use broot to figure out where the file is. In ArcoLinux, it is located here `/usr/share/hwdata/usb.ids`
In that file, we will see info that looks like this:

After determining the idVendor and idProduct for the device that we want to work with,


You can pass usbcore quirks as kernel parameters, see this page : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torva â€¦ meters.txt
Should be `usbcore.quirks=17ef:6047:gki`

I added the parameter to my loader config file and it works!
Reference: Where to put the parameter for anyone who has the same problem:  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_parameters

GRUB

To make the change persistent after reboot, you could manually edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg with the exact line from above, but the best practice is to: 
Edit /etc/default/grub and append your kernel options between the quotes in the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
And then automatically re-generate the grub.cfg file with:
`$ grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`
