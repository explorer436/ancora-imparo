What am I trying to achieve by using Emacs :

1. Set up REPL loops for programming. Haskell, Javascript, etc.
2. Working in a project and look for files by name and also look at file directory structure.
3. Navigate in and out of method declarations.
4. Search for a word everywhere in the project.
5. Replace a word everywhere in the project.

All of these can be solved by using Visual Studio Code.
