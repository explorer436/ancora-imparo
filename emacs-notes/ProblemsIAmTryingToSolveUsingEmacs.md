What am I trying to achieve by using Emacs :

1. Set up REPL loops for programming. Haskell, Javascript, etc.
2. Working in a project and look for files by name and also look at file directory structure.
   Achieved this using Projectile mode.
   This is also possible in Vim with fzf. So, this feature is not a deal breaker.
3. Navigate in and out of method declarations.
   I haven't figured out how to do this either in Vim or in Emacs.
4. Search for and/or replace a word everywhere in the project.
   This is also possible to do in Vim.

All of these can be solved by using Visual Studio Code.

And achieve speed of typing the same way we do in Vim. Is evil mode an answer to these?

Can we achieve these using Emacs? The answer is yes. But is it going to be easier? Or, should I just continue using Vim key bindings with evil mode?

Vim key bindings are the best. Even in emacs, without Vim keybindings, it would be kind of hard to achieve that level of comfort with typing.

1. make a change on multiple lines. e.g. change a word on 5 lines
1. jump till a full stop (period). forwards and backwards.
1. jump to the beginning of the paragraph.
1. jump to a character in a line from the current cursor position.
1. search for the occurance of a word in the entire project.
1. insert something at the beginning/ending of the line for multiple lines.
1. project directory exploration.
1. do certain search/replace only in visually selected text.
1. list all lines in a file where a given word occurs.
1. developer workflow in Emacs.

I have been using emacs for a few months now. Here is the list of things that I am enjoying using emacs:
1. Org mode - definitely. Even if I don't use anything else in emacs, I would install it just for org mode. A lot of my personal to do lists are now written using org mode.
2. magit - It is good. But I don't know if it is better than Vim fugitive or git terminal based commands. I am not sure if I would call it a deal breaker.
