What am I trying to achieve by using Emacs :

1. Set up REPL loops for programming. Haskell, Javascript, etc.
2. Working in a project and look for files by name and also look at file directory structure.
3. Navigate in and out of method declarations.
4. Search for a word everywhere in the project.
5. Replace a word everywhere in the project.

All of these can be solved by using Visual Studio Code.

And achieve speed of typing the same way we do in Vim. Is evil mode an answer to these?

What does Doom Emacs do?

Can we achieve these using Emacs?

make a change on multiple lines. e.g. change a word on 5 lines
jump till a full stop (period). forwards and backwards.
jump to the beginning of the paragraph.
jump to a character in a line from the current cursor position.
search for the occurance of a word. forwards and backwards.
search for the occurance of a word in the entire project.
insert something at the beginning/ending of the line for multiple lines.
project directory exploration.
running terminal commands from within emacs.
do certain search/replace only in visually selected text.
list all lines in a file where a given word occurs.
developer workflow in Emacs.
