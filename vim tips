In Linux, the vimrc file is in /etc
(if we want to edit it, we might have to do it as root)
------------------------------------------
LINE NUMBERS :
To display line numbers :set number
To turn off the line number display :set nonumber

To enable line numbers on startup, simply add the following to your vimrc - set number

RELATIVE LINE NUMBERS : 
To display line numbers relative to the line with the cursor, 
:set relativenumber or :set norelativenumber
------------------------------------------
SEARCHING : 

/pattern       - search forward for pattern
?pattern       - search backward
n              - repeat forward search
N              - repeat backward

:set ignorecase - case insensitive
:set smartcase  - use case if any caps used 
:set incsearch  - show match as search proceeds
:set hlsearch   - search highlighting

More cool searching tricks:

*               - search for word currently under cursor
g*              - search for partial word under cursor 
                  (repeat with n)
ctrl-o, ctrl-i  - go through jump locations
[I              - show lines with matching word under cursor

Search and replace...

:%s/search_for_this/replace_with_this/    - search whole file and replace
:%s/search_for_this/replace_with_this/c   - confirm each replace
------------------------------------------
Removing duplicate rows in vi :sort u

------------------------------------------
Quickly change word or line : 
To quickly change a word you can use cw,caw or ciw. 
Use c$ or just C to quickly change from the cursor to the end of a line, cc to change an entire line, or cis for a sentence
------------------------------------------
To append something to a word (at the end of the word) - ea

vi/vim search and replace: how to replace all tabs with spaces

vi/vim question: How do I convert all occurrences of ABC to XYZ in a file using the vi/vim editor?

Answer: This is actually easy to do with the vi or vim editor. Just go into "last line mode" by typing the ":" character, then enter a command like this to replace all occurrences of the string ABC with the string XYZ:

1,$s/ABC/XYZ/g

and then press [Enter]. This vi command replaces every occurrence of ABC with XYZ on every line, and even when there are multiple occurrences on a line.

I needed to convert all tab characters in a file with two spaces (I was converting some Java code someone gave me to standards that I follow). To convert each tab in the file to four spaces, I used this command:

1,$s/\t/    /g

Note that in both of these examples the "g" character at the end of the command means "global". If you don't use this "g" the tab character will only be replaced the first time it is seen on a line, but if you add the "g" at the end of the command every tab character in each line will be replaced.

To install ctags in centos:
1) Find the package you want to install
    $ yum list *ctags*
2) Install package
    $ yum install <packagename>

How to generate tags and use them for navigation in a big java project?
Go to the root folder of the project and execute this command : ctags -R

The next step is to get the full path of this tags file - in Linux, use the readlink utility to get the full path.
[n0281526@VDDP14P-4UCXMSH renters-api-sb2]$ readlink -f tags
/home/n0281526/Downloads/GitRepositories/renters-api-sb2/tags

open a file in the root folder of the project and run this command from within vim (use semi-colon and then type it)
set tags=./tags;/
(It starts with a tags file in the current directory and goes up to the root directory.)

Vim page up and page down keystrokes:
The Vim page up keystroke is [Control][b]. You can remember the 'b' by thinking "back".
The Vim page down keystroke is [Control][f]. You can remember the 'f' by thinking "forward".

You can use other keystrokes in Vim to move up and down, as shown here:
[Control][b] - Move back one full screen
[Control][f] - Move forward one full screen
[Control][d] - Move forward 1/2 screen
[Control][u] - Move back (up) 1/2 screen
